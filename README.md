# Develop

## Prerequisites

```bash
cargo install dioxus-cli
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## How to build

```bash
cargo build --release --features desktop
```

## Run

```bash
dx serve --hot-reload --platform desktop
```

# Issues

```shell-session
$ dx build --release                                                                                                                                                                        22:13:01

error: could not compile `tokio` (lib) due to 2 previous errors
```

I've tried to specify the features via `cargo add tokio --features sync,macros,io-util,rt,time`, but that
didn't fix it.

Interestingly, `cargo build --release` worked without error. Hmm.

# Thoughts on Dioxus

- Uses it's own cli tool `dx`, instead of using the default cargo build process. I dislike this.
- Small footprint (2.5mb release build) for a HTML/CSS GUI solution, uses the WebView of the system. Good.
  This is similar to Tauri (which essentially is used under the hood if I understood correctly),
  which I have tested [in the past](https://andreas-mausch.de/blog/2020-02-20-tauri/).
- The code can be re-used for all supported platforms, including mobile and web. Very nice.

Update 2025-02 (Dioxus 0.6.3):

- File size increased to 3.7mb for the release build
- There was no easy method to add a menu for a desktop app in Dioxus 0.4.3.
  This has changed and there is even an official [example](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/blob/v0.6.3/examples/custom_menu.rs)
  available. I just wonder if/how it is displayed for mobile apps, I
  haven't tested it yet.
- I had a look at the dynamic dependencies for the Linux build, and this is a bit
  disappointing: It is huge.
- Despite the little file size, the app still basically starts a browser which
  makes the start-up time a bit slow. It is not huge, but also not ideal.
